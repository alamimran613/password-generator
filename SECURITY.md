# Security Policy

## Security Philosophy

The Password Generator is designed with **privacy and security** as top priorities. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security concerns.

## Security Features

### Client-Side Only Processing

- **No Server Communication**: All password generation happens locally in your browser
- **No Data Transmission**: Your passwords never leave your device
- **No Tracking**: No analytics, cookies, or user tracking
- **Offline Capable**: Works completely offline once loaded

### Secure Password Generation

- **Cryptographically Sound**: Uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` with proper character distribution
- **No Predictable Patterns**: Passwords are generated with true randomness
- **Memory Safety**: Generated passwords are not stored in browser memory longer than necessary
- **No Logging**: No passwords are logged, cached, or stored anywhere

### Data Handling

- **Zero Data Collection**: We don't collect any user data
- **No Persistent Storage**: No passwords are saved to localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies
- **Clipboard Security**: Clipboard access is only used when explicitly requested by user
- **No External Dependencies**: Reduces attack surface by avoiding third-party libraries

## Known Security Considerations

### Browser Security

- **Math.random() Limitation**: While suitable for most use cases, Math.random() is not cryptographically secure
- **Clipboard API**: Clipboard access requires user permission and HTTPS in production
- **Browser Extensions**: Third-party browser extensions could potentially access page content

### Recommendations for Enhanced Security

- **Use HTTPS**: Always access the generator over HTTPS
- **Update Browser**: Use the latest version of your browser
- **Review Extensions**: Be cautious of browser extensions that can access page content
- **Clear Clipboard**: Clear your clipboard after using generated passwords

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x.x   | âœ… Yes    |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Use HTTPS**: Always access via HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **Verify Source**: Download from official repository only
- **Regular Updates**: Use the latest version for security improvements
- **Clear Browser**: Clear browser cache and history after use if on shared computer

### For Developers

- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo security review
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **No Eval**: We never use `eval()` or similar dangerous functions
- **CSP Headers**: Content Security Policy headers recommended for deployment

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### What to Report

- Authentication bypasses
- Data exposure vulnerabilities
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Privacy violations
- Any security-related concerns

### How to Report

**For Private Reports:**

- **Email**: <alamimran613@live.com>
- **Subject**: "SECURITY: Brief description"
- **Encryption**: Use PGP if available

**Report Template:**

```
**Vulnerability Type**: [XSS, Code Injection, etc.]
**Severity**: [High/Medium/Low]
**Description**: Detailed description
**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Step one
2. Step two
**Impact**: What could an attacker do?
**Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots
**Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas
**Environment**: Browser, OS, version
```

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 1 week
  - Medium: 2 weeks
  - Low: 1 month

## Security Recognition

### Hall of Fame

We maintain a security researchers hall of fame to recognize those who help improve our security.

### Responsible Disclosure

- **Public Disclosure**: Only after fix is deployed
- **Credit Given**: Security researchers receive appropriate credit
- **No Legal Action**: We won't pursue legal action for good faith research

## Security Enhancements Roadmap

### Planned Improvements

- **Web Crypto API**: Migrate to crypto.getRandomValues() for better randomness
- **CSP Implementation**: Add Content Security Policy
- **Subresource Integrity**: Add SRI for any future dependencies
- **Security Headers**: Implement additional security headers

### Under Consideration

- **Offline PWA**: Progressive Web App for complete offline usage
- **Hardware Keys**: Integration with hardware security keys
- **Audit Reports**: Third-party security audits
